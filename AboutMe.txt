I am a Christian. I believe in putting God above everything.
I am 19 years old and a Senior at UNCG majoring in Computer Science. 
I enjoy sports like basketball and tennis as well as occasional weight lifting.
I have four brothers and am the middle child. I pray the world would come to know
what Jesus truely did on the cross. And that there's salvation through repentence
and trust in Jesus.
