I am a lecturer of Computer Science. I have a MS in Comp Sci from UNCG, and a  
BS in Computer Science from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
I like (some) superheroes and puzzles. I solve my Wordle at 12:01 am every day.
Just like most basic people, I like hiking too. I also like history tidbits so I listen to 
Behind The Bastards, The Dollop, Well There's Your Problem, Ridiculous History and the like. I am 
currently reading "Quackery: A Brief History Of The Worst Ways To Cure Everything".
This is the way.

I am a Christian. I believe in putting God above everything.
I am 19 years old and a Senior at UNCG majoring in Computer Science. 
I enjoy sports like basketball and tennis as well as occasional weight lifting.
I have four brothers and am the middle child. I pray the world would come to know
what Jesus truely did on the cross. And that there's salvation through repentence
and trust in Jesus.
